## Description

The **Recipe Sharing App** is a full-stack web application built using the **MERN** stack (MongoDB, Express.js, React, and Node.js). It allows users to create, share, and manage their favorite recipes all in one place.

Users can sign up, log in, and add their own recipes with detailed ingredients, cooking instructions, and images. They can also view recipes added by others, mark them as favorites, and manage their own list of creations.

The application supports real-time image uploads, recipe filtering based on ownership or favorites, and interactive recipe details view. This makes it a helpful platform for food bloggers, home cooks, and culinary enthusiasts to store and showcase their creations.
